# Physics System Implementation

The physics system uses a custom implementation with simplified Newtonian mechanics.

## üîß Key Components

### üß≤ Gravity

Constant acceleration applied to vertical velocity:

```javascript
ballVelocity.y += GRAVITY * delta;
```

Where `GRAVITY = -9.8` (m/s¬≤)

---

### üöÄ Projectile Motion

- Initial velocity calculated from shot power and direction
- Separate horizontal and vertical components

```javascript
const initialSpeed = shotPower / 4;
const upwardForce = 7;
ballVelocity.copy(direction).multiplyScalar(initialSpeed);
ballVelocity.y += upwardForce;
```

---

### üí• Collision Response

#### üü´ Ground Collision

Velocity reversed and scaled by bounciness coefficient:

```javascript
ballVelocity.y *= -BALL_BOUNCINESS;
```

#### üü¢ Rim Collision

Direction-dependent bounce with spin effect:

```javascript
const spinPower = 0.5 * Math.sin(angleDiff);
ballVelocity.x += spinPower * horizontalVec.z;
ballVelocity.z -= spinPower * horizontalVec.x;
```

---

### üß± Collision Detection

#### üßä Custom Rim Collision

Uses cylinder math to detect contact:

```javascript
const rimContact =
  Math.abs(verticalDist) < ballRadius + rimThickness &&
  horizontalDist > rimHoleRadius - ballRadius &&
  horizontalDist < rimRadius + ballRadius;
```

---

### üîÆ Trajectory Prediction

Simulates the ball's flight path before actually shooting:

```javascript
for (let i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
  tempVelocity.y += GRAVITY * 0.016;
  tempPos.add(tempVelocity.clone().multiplyScalar(0.016));
}
```
